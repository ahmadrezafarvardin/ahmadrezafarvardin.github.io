    # Projects:
    #   - name: Mathematical Expression Recognition System
    #     summary: >
    #       Built a deep learning pipeline for Persian handwritten mathematical expression recognition.
    #       Designed components for detection (YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN), clustering (K-Means/DBSCAN),
    #       and recognition (CRNN + CTC loss). Achieved 92.3% mAP on detection and 54.35% recognition
    #       accuracy; implemented semi-supervised learning for improvement.
