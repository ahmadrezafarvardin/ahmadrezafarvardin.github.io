## Overview

A portfolio of diverse applications developed for the **Advanced Programming** course at the **University of Tehran**. These projects demonstrate the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns.

## Featured Projects

### 🎮 UTaste (Full-Stack App)
A comprehensive food ordering system with a separation of concerns:
*   **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
*   **Backend:** C++ core logic handling user sessions, order processing, and data persistence.
*   **Architecture:** Modular design with distinct layers for Communication, Data Loading, and Exception Handling.

### ⚔️ Sheep Fight (Game)
A graphical strategy game implemented in C++:
*   Includes multimedia assets (audio, fonts, images).
*   Features custom game loop and rendering logic.

### 🧠 Leitner System
An implementation of the spaced repetition learning method:
*   Structured with unit tests to verify algorithm correctness.
*   Demonstrates proper memory management and class design.

### 🚗 Management Systems
*   **Parking Management:** Tracking vehicle entry/exit and space allocation.
*   **Financial Management:** Transaction recording and reporting system.

## Key Concepts
*   **Encapsulation & Abstraction**
*   **Design Patterns** (MVC, Factory)
*   **Memory Management**
*   **Unit Testing**
