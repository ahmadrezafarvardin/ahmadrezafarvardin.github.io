## Overview

A collection of C++ implementations for the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course at the **University of Tehran**, focusing on memory management, graph theory, and efficient query processing.

## Assignments Breakdown

### CA1: Music Player Simulation
*   **Design:** Modular object-oriented architecture.
*   **Core Structure:** Circular Doubly Linked List for playlist management.
*   **Pattern:** State pattern for handling playback controls (Play, Pause, Next, Previous).

### CA2: Advanced Graph Algorithms
Solutions to 5 competitive programming-style problems involving complex graph traversals and optimizations:

| Problem | Key Concepts | Technique |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Q1** | Bottleneck Paths | Kruskal's MST + LCA with Binary Lifting |
| **Q2** | Fuel Constraints | Dijkstra's Algorithm with state expansion |
| **Q3** | Traffic Delays | Modified Shortest Path with waiting times |
| **Q4** | Dynamic Routing | Extended state Dijkstra with refueling logic |
| **Q5** | Range Queries | Fenwick Tree + Coordinate Compression |

## Technologies Used
*   **C++17** (STL, Pointers)
*   **Makefiles** for build automation
*   **GDB** for debugging
