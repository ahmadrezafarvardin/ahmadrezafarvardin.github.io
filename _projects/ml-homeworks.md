## Overview

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the **Machine Learning** course assignments at the **University of Tehran**. It covers a wide range of classical ML algorithms, implemented from scratch or using standard libraries, to demonstrate core concepts.

## Assignments Breakdown

The course was structured into 5 main assignments, progressing from basic probability to advanced clustering:

### HW1: Probability & Classification
*   **Naive Bayes Classifier:** Implementation from scratch.
*   **Data Analysis:** Visualization and preprocessing on the Iris dataset.
*   **Metrics:** Confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-score analysis.

### HW2: Linear Models
*   **Ridge Regression:** Regularized linear regression.
*   **Logistic Regression:** Binary classification with L2 regularization.
*   **Feature Selection:** Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) algorithm.

### HW3: Ensemble Methods
*   **Bagging & Boosting:** Implementation of AdaBoost and Bagging classifiers.
*   **Phishing Detection:** Applying ensemble methods to detect email phishing.
*   **Comparison:** Benchmarking custom implementations against **XGBoost**.

### HW4: Neural Networks & Dimensionality Reduction
*   **Neural Networks:** Analysis of activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).
*   **PCA & LDA:** Principal Component Analysis vs. Linear Discriminant Analysis.
*   **Kernel PCA:** Non-linear dimensionality reduction for noise removal.

### HW5: Clustering & Mixture Models
*   **GMM:** Gaussian Mixture Models implementation from scratch.
*   **K-Means:** Applied to **Image Segmentation**.
*   **Evaluation:** Silhouette Coefficient and Davies-Bouldin Index.
*   **Visualization:** Using **t-SNE** to visualize high-dimensional clusters.

## Technologies Used
*   **Python** (NumPy, Pandas)
*   **Scikit-Learn**
*   **TensorFlow / Keras**
*   **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

## Note
The assignment descriptions and theoretical answers are primarily in **Persian**, while the code and technical comments are in **English**.
