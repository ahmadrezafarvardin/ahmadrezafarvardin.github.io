I am a **Mathematics and Computer Science** student at the 
[University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), combining the rigorous 
mindset of a mathematician with a passion for Artificial Intelligence.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning** — Theory and applications
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** — Understanding and building language AI
- **Generative Models** — Diffusion models, GANs, VAEs
- **Computer Vision** — Visual understanding and generation

## What Drives Me

I believe in the power of mathematical foundations to build better AI systems. 
My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical 
applications in deep learning.
